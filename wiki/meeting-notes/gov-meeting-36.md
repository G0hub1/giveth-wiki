New unicorns get a very basic income (€450) per week and they receive €450 per week solely to donate to other peoples' milestones. What should someone have to do to qualify to become a unicorn. No cap on how much someone can receive in donations. 

Yalor: Need a current unicorn vote to unboard a new person. Recommendation/sponsor
How will we stop collusion? Why wouldn't two people just dish each other funds

Kay: Have a template on how to onboard with steps

Oz: 3 step requirements to be a unicorn.  Disincentive for people that dont donate the money ther were given for other milestones. Send it somewhere people might not want to fund
Adding feature to easily view who is sending to who
(V said its on the roadmap)

Griff: Bring back the Daily Giveth Jitsi room, twice a month
It is a transparent network so collusion wold be each to see
The giveaway amount should be for Giveth people and projects

Adam: Larger collusion networks?

### Adria to fork Giveth to bring to mainnet 
If he can't use the Dapp by July 1st
Giveth probably needs an initial donor that is willing to risk his ETH.  Adria stepped up to fund a friends NGO and will risk money to test Giveth on mainnet.  
Adria is suited for this, he knows the Dapp. 
We should onboard causes that have people begging to donate to them
