### Point1
Tabled

### Point2
Giveth DAC should not pay for meat at meetups.

#### Tension
New movement of social responsibility goes through Silivon Valley - we should also adopt a policy like that, because it fits the mission 'Making the world a better place'

#### Proposal
Giveth DAC should not pay for meat at meetups.

#### Clarifying Questions
Please refer to video!

#### Reactions
Kay - Likes proposal, won't have much impact because small team except events <br>
Lindsay - Against. Adds more complication and impact questionable. <br>
Griff - Likes proposal more now than at beginning, but similar objections: impact questionable and stressful in practice. Ethical belief and decision should be per campaign. <br>
Kris - Would like to see something with more impact. Maybe cut down flying within Europe? <br>
Alex - Not great idea - execution hard. Restaurants can not always tell you accurately.

#### Amend and Clarify
Whether big or small impact. Impact itself counts. We take alcohol off the bill - why would this be different? Don't want to change the proposal. Disappointed by opposition.

#### Result
TABLED

### Point3
Add Mitch as reviewer.

#### Tension
Mitch is reviewer in real life. Would like to put him on whitelist to get ETHprize onto Giveth!

#### Proposal
Get Mitch on the whitelist.

#### Clarifying Questions
Kris - Is this a separate campaign or DAC? <br>
Griff - Would expect him to not be very active, but he could create what he wants once whitelisted. <br>
Kris - Whats the benefit for ETHprize? <br>
Griff - ETHprize is a non-legal entity. Fits into the model of Giveth style organizations. Would enable them to make blockchain better. <br>
Kris - Will they be receiving donations? <br>
Griff - The will actually give donations. I will donate much. It starts with grants for POA network.

#### Reactions
Kay - Love it. Mitch is for sure technical and experienced with Ethereum. Nice to onboard somebody with tech knowledge as first external reviewer. <br>
Kris - Sounds great, but this one is on the DApp team to decide. Should not yet receive donations. <br>
Alex - toggled off <br>
Lindsay - disconnected

#### Amend and Clarify
This is actually away a bit - maybe by September we will be there. ere

#### Result
PASSED

### Point4 Whitelist Parker


#### Tension
Parker wants to create a 'grants' campaign. He should be whitelisted to do so.

#### Proposal
Whitelist Parker.eg

#### Clarifying Questions
Kris - Should this be on Governance campaign? <br>
Griff - This should not be in Gov, but its own thing, because it integrates with so many parts of Giveth DAC.

#### Reactions
Kris - Fine with it. But if all the grants are for Giveth only, could be part of governance. <br>
Kay - Likes every new tester. Cements Parker as go-to person for grants which is nice. Hopefully adds transparency and oversight.

#### Amend and Clarify
Proposal stands. 

#### Result
PASSED 

## Check-out
Kris - Crazy meeting. <br>
Cara - Thanks for meeting <br>
Lindsay - Connection problems. <br>
Griff - Summer is for living. Excited people live their life outside.
