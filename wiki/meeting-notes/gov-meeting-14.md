<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Agenda:

1 Roles in DApp
2 Milestones old dapp</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">
</span>

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Point 1.</span>**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tension:</span> Roles in DApp, lack of clarity around who goes where...

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Proposal:</span> We need to just make sure all the roles in the DApp are filled, I'm hoping we can use this space to brainstorm all the roles and lists we need to have detailed and then i can spend the next week getting everyone on board

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Clarifying question:</span> None

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Reactions:</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Vojtech: </span>

Roles:

Campaign managers (Kris, Jordi, Griff, Vojtech)

Delegate (Griff)

Campaign Reviewer (assigned from outside the group)
	Each milestone reviewer is randomly assigned

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">RJ:</span> Whitelists are used for random reviewer assigning, creating campaign/milestone, delegate.

Whitelist in liquidPledging - only owner can update or add plugins

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Reviewer whitelist
Delegate whitelist</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">campaign/milestone whitelist
</span>Alsoâ€¦ everyone will need to either make new addresses for their Giveth roles or they will need to do some fancy web3 things to keep their old address (you can talk to RJ about it for help) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Satya/Kay:</span> Nothing to add<span style="text-decoration:underline;">
Oz:</span> Whitelist should be open to devs

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">New proposal:</span> Griff will go around and make sure that all these roles have people to fill them. For the most part people will need to make new addresses to back them up, unless they want to create a specific keystore file from their private key. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">
</span>

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Point 2.</span>**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tension:</span> Old DApp not working reliably anymore - what to do with open milestones?

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Proposal</span>: Milestones from old dapp start to accumulate with no way of easy interaction - either move them to new DApp, or allocate resources in fixing the old one

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Clarifying question:</span> None

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Reactions:</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kay:</span> Issue should be dealt with priorities on technical side

Griff: We should move to the new dapp, people can make their own milestones its cheaper for gas and easier for everyone make a new campaign for migration?

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">RJ: </span>remove the old campaigns and the dapp will be faster

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Vojtech: </span>New Dapp is the way to go

Oz: Sounds good. Doesn't want to give too many resources to old Dapp

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">New proposal: </span>Swiftly solve issue to begin a fresh new year. Jen was in charge of milestones, but currently has limited availability. Satya and Griff make campaign on new DApp based on old milestones - tracked in Excel sheet.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">

</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Check out:</span>

All around the impression of a great and quick meeting!

End of meeting:  18:40 pm

@channel! The Summary from today's governance meeting:
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Point 1:</span> The DApp has many roles to dish out, we must have a keyfile to accept the roles and interact with the DApp, if you want to use your MetaMask key, you will need to export the private key and create a keystore file encrypted by a password..

Some roles have been decided:



*   Campaign managers (Kris, Jordi, Griff, Vojtech)
*   Delegate (Griff)

Some Roles need to be decided upon:



*   Campaign Reviewer (assigned from outside the group)

Some Roles will be randomly assigned from a whitelist:



*   Each milestone reviewer is randomly assigned

There are 2 whitelists that need to be populated:
1. Reviewer whitelist (People randomly selected to be a reviewer when a milestone is created)
2. Instigator Whitelist (People that are allowed to create Milestones and Campaigns)


**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Point 2.</span>**

Old DApp not working reliably anymore so we are going to make a Migration Campaign to take care of the old milestones not added to the new DApp yet. Jen, Satya and Griff will manage it.
