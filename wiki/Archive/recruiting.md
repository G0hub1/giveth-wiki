*These web pages and their contents hold no bearing on anything legal or otherwise. These are merely playful ideas on a virtual page that do not mean to convey any action or direction in actual reality.*

### Strategy
Giveth is an underground cause. It is recreational. To continue development we try to keep things fun and rely on the inspiration of talented contributors.

### Contributing
Each contributor starts as a regular community member of the Giveth community on Riot. All members are free to volunteer efforts to support Giveth projects in any way they want, or not. Tasks can be suggested on Riot by one member (let’s say @griff) and completed by another member of the community (for example @jbaylina).

### Policy
Each contributor is their own lead but they are accountable for communicating their role through the [roles prcess](../policy/roles.md)

### Reward Dao
The Reward Dao stems from an altruistic notion of community contribution. It is an evolving experiment to find a reward model that could eventually be fully automated.

Instead of “paying” individuals for tasks, which can devalue their time as a commodity, Giveth aims to reward contributors for their spontaneous inspirations. Volunteers that contribute to Giveth projects are rewarded by team voting that may occur once or every two weeks.
