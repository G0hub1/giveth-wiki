<h1>Social Coding</h1>

Welcome to the little 'homepage' of the Giveth Social Coding Circle!

Welcome to the living and breathing core of Giveth, where we cultivate learning and support innovative projects, with a focus on blockchain for (social) good. We created a safe space for altruistic developers to talk about their passion projects, and help them recruit or find help and guidance from peers. We have served as an incubator for many of the projects in our Galaxy ([DAppNode, BrightID, TennaGraph, our Blockternship Hackathon ...](https://giveth.io/#galaxy)) and this is only the beginning.

To get a good idea of what the circle is about please check out the article ["What is Social Coding?"](https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-social-coding-fa81feacfa32) by Quazia.

Social Coding Meetings are held bi-weekly online and can be found scheduled on the [Giveth calendar](../dac/calendar/). The meeting room can be found [here](https://meet.jit.si/giveth-socialcoding) and the corresponding Riot channel is [here](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-social-coding:matrix.org), feel free to join us!
If you want to get a feel of what we discuss during our bi-weekly meetings, most of them can be found on our [Giveth Transparency YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdqmP4axeI1hNmX20aZsOwg).

Below you can find an overview of the goals we are working towards.

If you have any question or are interested to contribute, feel free to reach out to @bowensanders in the #socialcoding channel on [Riot](http://giveth.io/join)!


<h2> Primary Goals </h2>

* Provide resources, education and support for developers, focusing on blockchain4good & boosting the Ethereum/blockchain ecosystem

* Create a safe space for developers to communicate their passion projects, then recruit help or guidance from peers.

<h2> Secondary Goals </h2>

* Making sure that the smart contracts we create are well documented, and any project that wants to build out using any of our tech has the guidance that they need.

* Oversee anything beyond basic DApp development in the Giveth Galaxy
