# Smart Contract Roadmap

### 2017

*11/08* - Withdraw contract  
- White Hat Group members will use to withdraw 50% of donated funds based on their contributions to this summer's rescue of over $200 million worth of ether and tokens.

*11/15* - Critical for promoting MLP to mainnet  
- Liquid Pledging Plugins (LPPs) should issue tokens on withdrawal. 10 lines of code. 2 days.  
- Whitelist plugins using hash of code. Fast. 2 days.  
- Merge escape hatch and limits into Liquid Pledging (LP) for security. 1 day.  

*11/23* - Promote MLP to mainnet  

*12/02* - After mainnet   
- Testing, testing, testing. Scenarios, edge cases. Understanding of contracts is needed for good edge cases.  
- Adapt LP to use any token instead of just ether. Product needs to decide which token.  
- Remove LP's dependency on vault contract by importing desired functionality into LP itself.  

*12/13* - Yoga Token  
- Minime ported to ERC 223. Community of work. Need to discuss with Foundation. Epoch snapshot. Carbon voting.  

*12/20* - Liquid Pledging UI  
- Complete Jordi's well defined requirements.   

*12/27* - Voting  
- Giveth provides and executes our first use case for voting on the blockchain. This will be a next step moving Giveth to a DAO.  

### 2018

*01/02* - Truffle PoC for Liquid Pledging (LP)  
- We want to make a PoC once Truffle upgrades to its next release. LP and the LP UI provide a solid use case because LP UI imports contract dependencies from external repos.
