# Smart Contract Roadmap

### 2017

*11/08* - Withdraw contract<br />
- White Hat Group members will use to withdraw 50% of donated funds based on their contributions to this summer's rescue of over $200 million worth of ether and tokens.

*11/15* - Critical for promoting MLP to mainnet<br />
- Liquid Pledging Plugins (LPPs) should issue tokens on withdrawal. 10 lines of code. 2 days.<br />
- Whitelist plugins using hash of code. Fast. 2 days.<br />
- Merge escape hatch and limits into Liquid Pledging (LP) for security. 1 day.<br />

*11/23* - Promote MLP to mainnet<br />

*12/02* - After mainnet <br />
- Testing, testing, testing. Scenarios, edge cases. Understanding of contracts is needed for good edge cases.<br />
- Adapt LP to use any token instead of just ether. Product needs to decide which token.<br />
- Remove LP's dependency on vault contract by importing desired functionality into LP itself.<br />

*12/13* - Yoga Token<br />
- Minime ported to ERC 223. Community of work. Need to discuss with Foundation. Epoch snapshot. Carbon voting.<br />

*12/20* - Liquid Pledging UI<br />
- Complete Jordi's well defined requirements.<br /> 

*12/27* - Voting<br />
- Giveth provides and executes our first use case for voting on the blockchain. This will be a next step moving Giveth to a DAO.<br />

### 2018

*01/02* - Truffle PoC for Liquid Pledging (LP)<br />
- We want to make a PoC once Truffle upgrades to its next release. LP and the LP UI provide a solid use case because LP UI imports contract dependencies from external repos.<br />
