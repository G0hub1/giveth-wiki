## Giveth Fund Forwarder - 0x5ADF43DD006c6C36506e2b2DFA352E60002d22Dc

@quazia and @griff developed a quick fix to prevent the loss of tokens donated to Giveth.

The source code for the FundForwarder can be found [here](https://github.com/Giveth/fund-forwarder/blob/master/contracts/FundForwarder.sol)

It's ABI and source code can also be found on [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ADF43DD006c6C36506e2b2DFA352E60002d22Dc#code)

It had 3 constructor parameters, which for our purposes are set as:

`_beneficiary` = 0x8702b8D7a1EeFEc7E54636E26A9323Dc96A8Dc25 (The current Giveth campaign address)

`_escapeHatchCaller` = 0x839395e20bbB182fa440d08F850E6c7A8f6F0780 [(Griff's Address)](https://twitter.com/thegrifft/status/755401659606528005)

`_escapeHatchDestination` = 0x8f951903c9360345b4e1b536c7f5ae8f88a64e79 (The Giveth Multisig)



## MyEtherWallet's Giveth Campaign

MyEtherWallet is one of Giveth's biggest supporters and has volunteered to be our first Public Alpha Tester for the Giveth Platform.

### Donation Flow

Donor donates -> Campaign (MYD sent to Donor) -> Vault 

The Main Donation address is the Campaign contract which catches tokens and issues MYD tokens, then sends the ether to the vault. 


### Contracts Deployed

MilestoneTracker: [Not yet Deployed]


### Required Set Up Parameters

#### Token Factory 


Allows you to clone the token to upgrade the token, create a vote, offer ICO access, basically give anyone that has this token the ability to do something specialâ€¦ this is permissionless too ;-) anyone can do this :-D


#### Campaign, Token Controller! 


1.  escapeDestination    0x97B47fE3Ed8d68Ee4b930b27598d08097F8eA9C6
2.  escapeCaller    0xDdA882a62600C452419145781e45052fdC06382C
3.  owner    0xDdA882a62600C452419145781e45052fdC06382C
4.  maximumFunding    10000000000000000000000 (Can only collect 1,000,000 ETH!!! MUST BE CHANGED IN THE CODE) 
5.  startFundingTime    1484933219 (the past)
6.  totalCollected    46741000000000000000  (Current balance: 46.741 ETH, 9953.259 to go)
7.  endFundingTime    1742699619 (some time in distant future)

This contract creates MYD and sends it to the Giver  

Special complications

Owner: Will start off as Quazia

Old Campaign will send 46.741 ETH  to new campaign

To keep tokens and total collected consistent, we will destroy the tokens created in step 2

We do a bunch of testing :-D

Owner will be changed to 0xDdA882a62600C452419145781e45052fdC06382C
