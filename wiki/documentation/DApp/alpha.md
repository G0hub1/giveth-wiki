# Giveth Donation Application (Alpha)

![MVP in Progress](../../images/screenshot-mvp.png)

## Current status
The Giveth Donation Platform is live in *alpha* stage on the Rinkeby Ethereum-testnet.

The plan was to operate on the main Ethereum-blockchain by now, but we found the current scaling issues on main net to be too prohibitive for real use, please see a more detailed account here:

## Help testing
We are currently testing with a small group, if you have questions or would like to participate in the process,
