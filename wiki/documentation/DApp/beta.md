# Giveth Donation Application (Beta)

![MVP in Progress](../../images/screenshot-mvp.png)

## Current status
The Giveth Donation Platform is live in *beta* stage on the Ethereum mainnet, bridged to Rinkeby testnet.

It's been a quest getting to mainnet efficiency, challenged by scalability issues that were too prohibitive for real use, but we have found a smooth solution with the bridge. You can read a more detailed account here: 
[Tackling Ethereum scalability issues (medium post)](https://medium.com/giveth/tackling-ethereum-scalability-issues-29bd700b5060)

We are growing our community steadily!  The Giveth Galaxy of builders is ever-expanding, and an update on our current status is available here:
