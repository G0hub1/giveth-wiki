# Giveth Donation Application (Beta)

![MVP in Progress](../../images/screenshot-mvp.png)

## Current status
The Giveth Donation Platform is live in *beta* stage on the Ethereum mainnet, bridged to Rinkeby testnet.

It's been a quest getting to mainnet efficiency, challenged by scalability issues that were too prohibitive for real use, but we have found a smooth solution with the bridge. You can read a more detailed account here:
