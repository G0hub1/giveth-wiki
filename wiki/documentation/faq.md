## When will this Wiki be finished?

Never! It is an evolving document that will continue to be updated by community members like you! ;-)

## What is a DAC?

A DAC is a **Decentralized Altruistic Community**.

They have a shared social media platform (like Slack, Rocket Chat, Discord, etc.) and use smart contracts to transparently allocate financial resources.

**Decentralized:** There are no central points of failure [*]. The cause that the DAC is organized around is what matters, not the leading organizations or egos. A DAC has the ability to build their own decentralized governance structure in whatever way they want, using whatever platform they want, or they can have no governance structure at all.

**Altruistic:** The cause a DAC focuses on is one that has trouble finding support in the for-profit market economy, such as helping the homeless, funding open source software projects, or supporting emergency relief after a natural disaster. The main piece is that the DAC is not focused on generating profit, they are focused on using #blockchain4good and trying to #maketheworldabetterplace in general.

**Community:** A group of individuals and organizations working together to achieve their goals.

[\*]Giveth’s Smart Contracts have centralizing security features (Like escape hatches) that are necessary in 2017 while working with this young smart contract tech, but all the centralizing security features have the ability to be turned off so the DAC can become truly decentralized; although we don’t recommend it at this stage.
