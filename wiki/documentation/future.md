# Ideas, Proposals and Concepts for Future versions

The purpose of this part of wiki is to list all the ideas, proposals and concept that could be included in future versions of the Giveth System. However, we do not guarantee that any of these ideas will be included.

## <a name="future-location">Locations of DACs, Campaigns and Milestones</a>
It would be useful to add multiple locations where the DACs, Campaigns and Milestones are happening. The proposal would be to:

1. Pick exact location (e.g. Address or GPS coordinates)
2. Pick a Country
3. Pick a Continent

If the user picks exact location, the Country and Continent is automatically deduced. If the Country is chosen, Continent is also autoatically deduced. Because DACs, Campaigns and even some milestones can be in multiple locations, the location field should be a list and not just single location. However, there should not be inheritance where the DAC would inherit the locations of its Campaigns.

## <a name="future-location-exploration">Location based exploration of DACs & Campaigns</a>
Assuming each DAC, Campaing and Milestone has a as described in [Locations of DACs, Campaigns and Milestones](#future-location), all these entities could be searched on a map or on a 3D globe. In a DAC you could see to which places the delegations goes and in Campaign the user could see where the individual milestones took place.

## <a name="future-money-exploration">Money flow based exploration of DACs & Capaigns</a>

Giveth already has a lot of information that it is not using at all. By analysing the transactions, we can easily build graphs that would help people understand wheir the DACs money go through and where the Campaign money comes from. This could be an important ascpect that Givers could consider.
