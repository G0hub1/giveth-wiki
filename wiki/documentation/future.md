# Ideas, Proposals and Concepts for Future versions

The purpose of this part of wiki is to list all the ideas, proposals and concept that could be included in future versions of the Giveth System. However, we do not guarantee that any of these ideas will be included.

## <a name="future-location">Locations of DACs, Campaigns and Milestones</a>
It would be useful to add multiple locations where the DACs, Campaigns and Milestones are happening. The proposal would be to:

1. Pick exact location (e.g. Address or GPS coordinates)
2. Pick a Country
3. Pick a Continent

If the user picks exact location, the Country and Continent is automatically deduced. If the Country is chosen, Continent is also autoatically deduced. Because DACs, Campaigns and even some milestones can be in multiple locations, the location field should be a list and not just single location. However, there should not be inheritance where the DAC would inherit the locations of its Campaigns.
