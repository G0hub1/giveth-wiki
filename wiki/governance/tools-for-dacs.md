# Distributed teams need distributed tools
Although we try to meet in person too, the most important aspect of running interconnected teams whose members are scattered around the globe comes down to the tools at our disposal. We always try to find the most open and expandable software tools to improve our organizational capability.

When we are looking at available software for organization, open-source comes first, usability second. Sometimes we have to make our own tool or most likely expand on the work previously done by others. Explore our world-readable logs on Youtube, our Wiki and the Chat - It should give you a good impression of who we are and what we are working on.

## Chat
The Giveth community mainly communicates through these platforms:
 - [Riot.im](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+giveth:matrix.org) (Integrative work chat) is currently the recommended option for joining the community

## Documents and Files
The Giveth DAC uses cloud-storage services for transparent document management. Most of our working documents are hosted and shared with Google Drive or hosted on this [wiki](https://github.com/Giveth/giveth-wiki).

## Organization
Currently we are evaluating [loomio](https://www.loomio.org) which is an excellent open-source solution for decision-making, polls and votes. Decisions and activity on Loomio is currently non-binding, but it is used to signal preferences.

## Accounting
