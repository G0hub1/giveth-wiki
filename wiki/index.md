# Welcome to the Giveth Wiki

**Hello friend!** Welcome to the [Giveth](http://giveth.io) Galaxy! 

We are a community focused on making the **world a better place** through the use of blockchain technology! Our flagship product, the Giveth Donation Application [DApp](https://giveth.io/#dapp) is striving to bring new governance models into the nonprofit space. We created the Giveth Galaxy to foster a larger network of organizations that will help us **build the future of giving** we envision; a truly decentralized one. 

The Galaxy consists of 4 Circles:

* [Governance](../dac/governance/)

* [Dapp](https://wiki.giveth.io/documentation/DApp/beta/)

* [Social Coding](https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-social-coding-fa81feacfa32)

* [Communications](../dac/communications/)

These also further subdivide internally for organisatinal purposes. Giveth is more than the sum of its parts, so if you are interested to know about some of the other things we focus on and why, head over to our [Mission Statement](https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/mission/)!

We are very active and keep an open [Calendar](../dac/calendar/) where you can find upcoming events and our community video discussions. You can also join our various chat channels on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+giveth:matrix.org).

Read about the primordial soup from which Giveth first emereged, our first smart contracts *MiniMe*, the *Vault* and much much more on our  [Medium](https://medium.com/giveth). 

We are a Community of Developers and **Makers**, we are the **Giveth Decentralized Altruistic Community ([Giveth DAC](https://giveth.io/#DAC))**, and we hope YOU will [join us!](http://join.giveth.io)
