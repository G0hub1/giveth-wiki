# Welcome to the Giveth Wiki

**Hello friend!** You came to the right place to learn about [Giveth](http://giveth.io)!

We started this wiki in 2017 and **with your help and input** it's growing every day!

Giveth is structured as a Galaxy, but the four main planets or "circles" are:

* [Governance](https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/governance/)

* [Dapp](https://wiki.giveth.io/documentation/DApp/beta/)

* [Social Coding](https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-social-coding-fa81feacfa32)

* [Communications](https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/communications/)

These also further subdivide internally for organisatinal purposes. Giveth is more than the sum of its parts, so if you are interested to know about some of the other things we focus on and why, head over to our [Mission Statement](https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/mission/)!

We are very active and keep an open [Calendar](../dac/calendar/) where you can find upcoming events and our community video discussions. You can also join our various chat channels on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+giveth:matrix.org).

Read about the primordial soup from which Giveth first emereged, our first smart contracts *MiniMe*, the *Vault* and much much more on our  [Medium](https://medium.com/giveth). 

If all this sounds rather curious and interesting, come and build Giveth! We invite all interested parties to do so: [Join the Giveth community!](http://join.giveth.io)
