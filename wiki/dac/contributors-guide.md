# Contributors Guide

The Giveth Decentralized Altruistic Community (DAC) is currently live in beta! We are actively using, testing and developing our DApp even as we are experimenting and growing in our workflows and governance practices. To Build the Future of Giving we need **your help**: may you be a developer, designer, writer, organizer, blogger, tester ... whatever you do or make, **we value your contribution** in the Giveth Decentralized Altruistic Community.

We show our appreciation to contributors by dishing points, awarded based on the circle your contribution supports. The 4 circles of the Giveth DAC are run as Campaigns on our Beta platform ([Dapp Development](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b39d45e14cec916d00dab20), [Communication](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b3789513a65c31e4e4e8328), [Governance](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b37e5caa239ac21b383d4dd), [Social Coding](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b3b3a34329bc64ae74d13cd)) and together they award a considerable amount in eth to contributors who add value to our Community, via our [RewardDAO](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b3d9746329bc64ae74d1424). 

Below we explain how you can become a contributor and how you can be awarded and rewarded for your efforts! 

## Step 1: Join us

  - We post issues to our [GitHub](https://github.com/giveth) repos and discuss the tasks in the [#contributors](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-contributors:matrix.org) room/channel on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+giveth:matrix.org) regularly, be sure to *join* this room together with the relevant circle's room/channel.
  - If we get to know you, we might also proactively *reach out* to you if we have tasks. To this end, you can fill out your info [here](http://bit.ly/GivethMaker). Know that through this info we can also refer you to non-profits that will be living on our platform, as they too will need your support.

## Step 2: Discuss your task

  - Once you have picked up a task, the ideal place to *discuss your progress or ask questions* is in the linked channel ([#Product Development](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-product-development:matrix.org), [#Communication](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-communication:matrix.org), [#Governance](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-governance:matrix.org), [#Social Coding](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-social-coding:matrix.org)) or in direct messages with the person who requested this task.
  - Once your task is completed and approved by the task requester, do *share the result* in the appropriate channel.
  - The task requester will *dish out points* for what you did in the relevant channel. These points will be paid out in ether at the end of the monthly reward period (shortly after each month completes and values are calculated).

## Step 3: Prove your work

  - Please *make a video* as proof of what you did:
    - Go to our [Wall of Fame](https://fame.giveth.io/), where you start by tapping/clicking on the ‘+’ (bottom right). Please note: Currently the Wall of Fame only supports Chrome browser
    - Create your video or upload an existing one, with your camera, using screen recording, or a combination of both.
    - Make sure you add your **chat handle** and a **public wallet address** that can hold ether.
    - **Share** the link to this video in the appropriate channels and in #contributors.

At Giveth we strongly believe in transparency and accountability, so we take this video proof very seriously, please take a few minutes to create this before the end of the month, so we can pay you out the awarded points in ether! For work done in the last few days of this period, we allow a 3 day grace period for the video.

## Step 4: Get rewarded

  - Point dishing for the month is closed off at midnight CEST on the last day of each month. Very shortly after this date [the representatives of the 4 circles convene](https://medium.com/giveth/how-rewarddao-works-aka-what-are-points-7388f70269a) and discuss how much points they awarded to each contributor and which amount is rolled over from the previous month.* Representatives can make changes to the points they awarded up to this date, which is especially relevant if more than one person dishes points for a specific circle. 
  - After discussion, the representatives assign ‘weight’ to the different circles for that month, which is translated into percentages and recalibrates the final amount of ether that is attributed to every contributor. If more than one person has voted per circle, the awarded points can be changed, so that the total of awarded points per circle still makes sense. 
  - The document with the final points and awarded ether is shared in the #contributors channel each month, and a spreadsheet that shows all points dished can be viewed by typing "!sheet" in the [#contributors](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-contributors:matrix.org) or any circle's [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+giveth:matrix.org) room. Internally, we use the Giveth DApp (running on [Rinkeby testnet](https://medium.com/giveth/tackling-ethereum-scalability-issues-29bd700b5060)) to track and pay out contributor rewards as soon as possible through Milestones. 

You can find the live sheet of the awarded points throughout a month [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12cblUYuYq4NwZX7JdRo0-NWnrOxlDy-XCbvF3ugzb2c/edit?usp=sharing) and the awarded eth per month plus the voting results in one sheet per month [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2gzflwFITCBdmYyb1BJcVp5bjg).

If you have any questions about your contribution (and linked award), please contact Dani (@danibelle:matrix.org) via a direct message on Riot.

&ast; Note: during 'calm' months (for example during the summer) when less points are dished, circles can decide to roll over part of the available eth to the next month, so that the dished points are a reasonable and fair amount in eth in comparison to previous months. The rolled over amounts are indicated in each sheet.
