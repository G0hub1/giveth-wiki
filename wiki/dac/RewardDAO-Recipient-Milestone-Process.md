**To Collect ETH from your Monthly Points Award:**

• Preliminary Step 1 - Create a profile on [beta.giveth.io](https://beta.giveth.io/) if you haven’t already!  

• Preliminary Step 2 - Verify the Ethereum Wallet Address where you will receive the funds if different from your linked MetaMask account, and have it available on your desktop to copy into the Milestone.

•Optional Step 3 - Record your video in advance.  You can upload directly to the Milestone by saving to your hard drive, upload it to YouTube (or other) to embed a link, or use the [Wall of Fame](https://fame.giveth.io/) to share it then link in Milestone.

**Now make your own Milestone:**

1) Go to the [RewardDAO Campaign](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5b3d9746329bc64ae74d1424), scroll past description and Propose Milestone.

2) Enter a Title that includes Your Name, the Month, and Campaign Name (RewardDAO).

3) Include your point acceptance speech in the text body.  
 * If you are pasting info from the Giveth-bot message or monthly [Calculation Spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B2gzflwFITCBdmYyb1BJcVp5bjg) about why you were dished, please edit the text to ‘tidy up’ the presentation, personalize the message etc.

 * This means making complete sentences of the snippets (found in the Milestone tab of Calculation Spreadsheet), add bullet points if you were dished points for more than 2 things.

4) Embed video to text body using the Insert Video icon. Example below is to insert a video previously stored on the Wall of Fame. You can also select File to upload a prerecorded video stored on your hard drive. The easiest method is to choose Camera or Screen sharing and record directly to the Milestone.

5) Add a picture that will be the image header on your Milestone

6) Click the selector to Disable Milestone Reviewer

7) Where will the money go after completion?  This is IMPORTANT to get CORRECT - simply clicking “Use My Address” below will populate the MetaMask Eth Address associated with your profile.  If you want it to go somewhere else, paste in and double check that address!!

8) RewardDAO is an Ether-funded campaign so make sure you are Raising funds in ETH.

9) IF you are making your Milestone BEFORE monthly voting has been completed on the monthly calculation spreadsheet, you will need to disable Milestone funding cap.

  * If your ETH amount has been calculated already, it is very helpful and transparent to include the complete information including what you were dished for and the exact amount, using the last day of the previous month as the date for Exchange Rate calculation.

10) Triple check all the fields, and click the Green button for Propose Milestone!


11) Go to My Milestones, make sure it’s there, it all looks good, and click the edit button if you missed anything!
Now, copy the URL address of your milestone and share it in the #contributors room on Riot to let us know you did it!
