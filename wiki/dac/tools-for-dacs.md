# DAC Toolbox
This page acts as a description of the tools used within Giveth that we feel are important to realize the basic operation of an efficient decentralized community.

We always aim to streamlines processes and transfer between tools if it increases transparency, security, usability or means being able to change a tool for an open-source alternative.

### Chat
The Giveth community mainly communicates through these platforms:
 - Riot.im (Integrative work chat) is currently the recommended option for joining the community

## Documents and Files
The Giveth DAC uses cloud-storage services for transparent document management. Most of our working documents are hosted and shared with Google Drive. Additionally we run our own [Sanstorm](https://sandstorm.io) installation for more sensitive files and documents.

## Organization
Currently we are evaluating [loomio](https://www.loomio.org) which looks like an excellent open-source solution for decision-making, polls and votes.
