## Agenda

*   Point1: What to do if not enough DAI
*   Point2: Weekly DApp Issue Prioritization
*   Point3: Vojtech's multisig handover
*   Fireside chat


### Point1

[What to do if not enough DAI](https://www.loomio.org/p/w86dlKyL/what-to-do-if-not-enough-dai)

#### Tension

When there is not enough DAI what do we do? Can we make milestones in ETH? In a previous community meeting and loomio we agreed we would stick to DAI for regular rewards


#### Proposal

Proposal was to stick with DAI. And that Griff would be responsible for keeping the funds filled with enough DAI for regular milestones. 

New proposal: Exchange the ETH into DAI if need be... a little confused here
We have one person assigned when funds arrive to Giveth who takes care of putting the available eth into dai so that we can stick with our current decision of paying out in DAI. 

#### Clarifying Questions

Loie - is this proposal valid? since it's a new proposal from what was on loomio and so it hasn't had the 24 hour period before the meeting<br>
Kris - no, this proposal didn't morph, it's the same as what was in the loomio<br>
Dani - is this proposal exclusive to reg rewards?<br>
Kris - no it's more any milestones besides reward dao<br>

#### Reactions

Griff - i like the idea of trying to convert the ETH to DAI but then the ppl who donated lose transparency... if we expand this later and they donate swarm city tokens and nobody wants to be paid in those, it would be reasonable to convert them and the donor loses transparency. this sends a message to the donors hey donate something usable if you want to track these donations, sets a precedent which is good to do. <br>
Lorelei - Happy with idea of appointing a person with exchanging. But who makes the decision to convert it and ... we have made money off of speculating eth as well. last week, i thought we were going to open up the rule so people can make the reg reward with eth... but in the end i'm not going to block it<br>
Kay - its a hard question... we are dealing with scarcity... griff usu does this, we can make a role out of the exchanger... I like the anti speculation aspect... this will be "sand under the bridge" later with xdai.... it would be interesting if we can just exchange within the dapp.... I abstain. <br>
Dani - it's important to limit the scope of this change you're suggesting now to reg rewards. it's a change in direction that we're making internally but it has influence in how its represented to our users. it could make things in our wiki incorrect, there's a bigger scope affected by this decision. <br>

#### Amend and Clarify

It seems like i have agreement, let's limit this to reg rewards, it doesnt have to change guidence for the dapp.... how giveth pays people shouldnt change how things work for everyone<br>
In order to avoid speculation in the DApp, we stick to regular rewards being paid in DAI, create a role in Roles Sheet for someone to turn eth into dai for reg rewards. my proposal is that person is griff since he's already doing that kind of stuff. <br>
*loie's concern of a huge donation what do we do with that: all such donations would get their own loomio and decision process to determine how that donation is held & disbursed <br>

Lets stick to DAI for reg rewards and put out a role through the roles process

#### Result

Approved

### Point3

Vojtech needs to leave 4 multisigs.

#### Tension

Vojtech is leaving these multisigs and we need to help him do that in the correct way for security and replace him with solid signers.

#### Proposal

Make loomio **decisions** for replacing V on each of the 4 multisigs. We will have a decision and a clear exit path to tell him by next week end of the governance cycle on Thursday.

#### Reactions

Kris - sounds good, thanks griff for mobilizing this proposal. We should make an announcement of scope for different multisigs to get nominated people for replacements, then push those to loomio decisions asap. <br>
Dani - there's plenty of us who have volunteered already. its happenin<br>
Kay - Michael now is a good replacement, maybe time zone tough but he's usually present. I'm happy if Griff takes the charge. Bowen has arrived!<br>
Bowen - tech difficulties<br>
Lorelei - Largely agree with proposed path


#### Amend and Clarify

Gonna try to do a moon-shooter, get it all done this week. Lay it all out in loomio what each multisig does and msg people individually to get nominations, and have votes end on Thursday. If we can't add ppl to a multisig in one week then we suck. I will beg Lorelei to crack the whip XD
The multisigs themselves will have to verify this decision as well

#### Result

PASSED
