### Point1 Double Milestones



#### Tension
We have a new workflow coming very soon for being paid, and we need to thoroughly test our DApp


#### Proposal
For every non-RewardDAO milestone, for it to be paid, it must have a LINK to a corresponding milestone created in our develop branch of the DApp that has been paid out. This is something Reviewers and Campaign Managers should check before paying out. This would help us ease into the new system.
You can make yourself the reviewer, make details easy but the point is you are getting used to and testing the new system before we open it up to giveth users! 

#### Clarifying Questions
Creating duplicate milestone? you can copy and paste? - yep! 
Do we just create it or do we follow the whole process thru to completion? - yes it has to be paid out
If we get stuck and can't make our milestone til the payment do we get paid in alpha? - No
Is there a retroactive? - Starts now - no whitelist, anyone can create milestone

#### Reactions
Yalda - good idea internal testing
Kay - would like to use one system, fears it will cause issues that might not be relevant in the end
Vojtech - makes a lot of sense, amend: as long as you've tried and you prove that you've tried, you can still get paid
Yalor - trouble with milestones as they are - would be good to have clear directions
RJ - all for it, in response to Kay:we can't make a clean shift to the new system b/c theres so many changes there are likely to be bugs
Kris - all for it
DappLion - happy to test
Edu - we need it
Lindsay - all in to get everybody involved in testing, agree with vojtech's amendment, as long as i don't have to do all 40 reward dao milestones ;)
Satya - great idea, if you did your best and failed because of glitch and filed github issue, you should still get to be paid
Lorelei - milestones are already complicated, but we need this so i support! 
Taylor - usability issues are our biggest prob so i support this


#### Amend and Clarify
Make the loomio be our wiki essentially, a one pager for tips, links to github issues. For the first week, if you show (in github, linked in milestone) that you encountered an issue in test, you can still get paid. 
Yalda proposed: keep the one pager private until someone runs through process, documents where they got stuck, then they can unlock the directions
Campaign managers and reviewers will be double checking to see there is a link in the dev version of the dapp to the milestone in alpha. They will ONLY accept it to be paid IF the alpha milestone has gone thru from creation to payout in ropsten, OR they have linked to an issue they created in github showing why they could not move thru completely in alpha.

#### Result
PASSED

### Point3 Do we thank anyone?


#### Tension
We received a donation from a pyramid scheme, they were thanked, pr mishap ensues


#### Proposal
Griff - avoid the whole topic and not thank anyone - throw away yalors post

#### Clarifying Questions




#### Reactions
Yalor - approve, especially til we can get together and think about a plan
Kris - makes sense to put this on hold
Edu - hard topic. we need to talk in BCN about it. 
DappLion - distracted, nothing to say
RJ - Discuss in BCN, don't do anything until we can discuss
Satya - no reaction
Lindsay - agree to discuss it there
Vojtech - we should research actual legal implications in the meantime before we have this discussion, we shouldn't spend the money until a clear decision is made on this
Yalda - legal liability will transfer to individuals in the absence of a corporation, i'm happy to send a drafted question to my lawyer, seedum was less than one eth, lets return it




#### Amend and Clarify
We will not do any actions about the money now, keep it but not spend it, send no thank you to anyone. In the meantime Vojtech and Yalda and anyone else with access to legal expertise will ask this question and then we'll have a well informed discussion in Barcelona. 


#### Result
