## Agenda

*   Point1 - Switch Giveth Regular Rewards and Expenses to DAI

### Point1
This Agenda item consists of more than one single proposal and is best explained by the loomio it references: [https://www.loomio.org/d/aAu5qy6h/switch-giveth-reg-rewards-and-expenses-to-dai](https://www.loomio.org/d/aAu5qy6h/switch-giveth-reg-rewards-and-expenses-to-dai)

#### Tension
Requiring Reg Rewards to be in DAI would stop default mode of speculation for salaries. In general running a donation campaign in DAI is probably the preffered solution for most changemakers (and using DAI a lot ensures the functionality is and stays working).

#### Proposal
We switch Reg Reward and Expenses to DAI (required for those - no more ETH milestones will be accepted). Reward DAO stays in ETH. We get more DAI by soliciting more donations. From 15th dec all milestones for reg rewards

#### Clarifying Questions
No notes here - please refer to video.

#### Reactions
Kris - would like to choose himself. solicit funds in DAI
Kay - many different thoughts on this. In general appreciates and supports the proposal.
Bowen - supports the proposal

#### Amend/Clarify
Move to DAI for reg reward, expenses. Eth stays Eth. Claim DAI milestones. Starting from Dec 15th milestones for Expenses, Reg Reward has to be filed in DAI. Reward DAO stays in ETH.

#### Result
Approved

Fireside chat follows.
