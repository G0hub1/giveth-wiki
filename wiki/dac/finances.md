## <a name="donations">Donations</a>

Giveth is a Decentralized Altruistic Community, meaning we depend on generous Givers ourselves. If you want to help us build the Future of Giving by contributing any amount, big or small, please contact @griffgreen on [Riot](http://riot.giveth.io) or donate directly to the address ```revolution.eth``` (which resolves to ```0x5ADF43DD006c6C36506e2b2DFA352E60002d22Dc```).

You can see the options in more detail on our [Donation Page](https://donate.giveth.io)

## <a name="finances_budget">Budget Overview</a>
One of the core values of Giveth is transparency. We invite everyone to consult our publicly accessible expenses and budgets:
 - [2018](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qg7OiQ42jmsW3HCgtGA-v5NfxMEAR5SMo_oc7AtEqTE/edit?usp=sharing)
 - [2017](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qg7OiQ42jmsW3HCgtGA-v5NfxMEAR5SMo_oc7AtEqTE/edit?usp=sharing)

## <a name="finances_expenses">Expense Claiming</a>

Giveth related expenses can be claimed through the Expense Claim form. If you never had an expense with Giveth before, you need to contact the team first.

By default Giveth Covers:

- Conference tickets where the whole Giveth Team goes
- Transportation tickets to and from official Giveth Team Meetups
- Food and non-alcoholic drinks consumed while at official Giveth Team Meetups
- Suitable accomodation for the duration of official Giveth Team Meetups chosen by Giveth Team.
- Office expenses (rent,  utility bills, equipment, groceries for Giveth Team Meetups)

By default only expenses with valid receipt are covered. Any expense will be judged by the Finance lead, its value converted to US dollars (according to [xe.com](http://www.xe.com)) and then Ether (using [EtherPrice API](https://etherchain.org/documentation/api/)) at noon on the day the expense took place. The refund will be made at earliest convenience through the Expenses Campaign on Milestone Tracker [http://dapp.giveth.io/#/campaigns/4](http://dapp.giveth.io/#/campaigns/4).
