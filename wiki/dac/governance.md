# Description of Giveth DACs governance model

## Philosophy:

Every single person within the Giveth team is a Unicorn. Unicorns as such don't like to be ruled or overpowered, they like to be free in their decision making. This is why our governance model is always in progress and not fixed. As a Decentralized Altruistic Community we understand that people need time and space to develop new skills. Nevertheless a team needs some kind of organization. This is why we work with the system of holacracy but we adapt it the way we need it. We have several online team meetings to structure and organize the team. Regular meetings are:
###Giveth governance-meetings.

Where: https://meet.jit.si/daily-giveth

Description: The aim is to discuss tensions and find solutions within Giveth.
####Guidelines & Roles for governance-meetings:
Facilitator: The Facilitator is the moderator of the meeting and holds the space so that people can process their tension on their own and react as they need to express themselves freely in a safe and controlled space.The Facilitator is encouraged to interrupt when people are getting off topic and is discouraged from making extra commentary or from coaching. It is very important that the Facilitator stay neutral.
Secretary: The Secretary needs to stay curious and calm. The Facilitator can be the Secretary as well for smaller meetings but in general it is best if they are 2 different people. The secretary takes notes the best they can, this often will help us create a blog post out of our weekly meeting.
Proposer: The Proposer needs to stay curious and calm. They are the person who put a tension on the agenda. It is their responsibility to propose a solution to the tension and it is their responsibility to make sure that their solution will likely alleviate their tension. It is NOT their responsibility to solve other people’s problems. One tension at a time. Don’t feel pressured to solve other people’s problems with your solution. Everyone is an adult and we need everyone to take care of themselves. That starts with you taking care of your responsibilities. You do not have to take any of the feedback you received.  
Reactors: The Reactors are everyone who is not the Proposer during the decision making process. They are encouraged to freely react however they want during the reaction round.
Meeting process:
1. Check in
Everyone calls out what is distracting them, and states a 20 second or less intention for the meeting. One person speaks at a time, NO discussion.
2. Facilitator States Meeting Logistics
A simple space to triage any administrative and logistical issues to take into account for the meeting.
3. Building the Agenda
The goal is to build an agenda of tensions to process. Each agenda item is limited to 3 words MAX. There is no specific order and anyone can add items to the agenda. The Secretary captures the agenda items for everyone. The facilitator will determine the order these agenda items are processed.
3. Process each agenda item with the Integrative Decision Making process. The Facilitator encourages everyone to take notes and determines the order these agenda items are processed on the fly.

Present Proposal
The proposer describes a tension and makes a proposal to resolve it. Only the proposer speaks.

Clarifying Questions
Anyone can ask questions to better understand the proposal. The proposer then has a chance to respond. This is not a space for back and forth discussion; rather, the pace is one answer for one question; pause; then next question.
It’s NOT allowed to use clarifying questions to give an opinion about the proposal. Opinions, suggestions, reactions, all should be left for the Reaction round coming next. The Facilitator will cut off any question that’s conveying an opinion or isn’t intended at better understanding the proposal. There is no hard line between clarifying question and reaction, and it’s at the Facilitator’s discretion to discern between the two. The proposer can answer the questions;one at a time.

Reaction round
One at a time, each person reacts to the proposal as they see fit. No response or interruption is allowed during someone’s reaction. Any type of reaction is welcome, from intellectual critiques to emotional outbursts. The only rule is that reactions should not be engaging someone in particular. Everyone reacts except the proposer.
Reactions are the only step of the governance meeting when people can speak freely. It’s a perfect phase for providing different perspectives and suggesting improvements to the proposal, so that the proposer can integrate those changes if he or she likes them. This is the dangerous part of this meeting if people want to keep talking and talking… that is ok, and HAS to be allowed. This could make these meetings long.

Amend & Clarify
After all reactions are complete, the proposer can optionally clarify the intent of the proposal, or amend it based on the reactions. Only the proposer speaks; no discussion allowed. Although the proposer can modify the proposal however they want, the goal is for the proposer to amend their proposal if they found a better way to address their tension. It’s not his job to address all the concerns and reactions he heard during the reaction round, or even to make improvements that were suggested by other participants.

Objections
One at a time, the Facilitator asks each participant if they see “any reason why adopting this proposal would cause harm or move Giveth backwards.”  The proposer also gets the opportunity to raise an objection. Objections are stated, tested, & captured without discussion. One person may have several objections, and everyone’s objections must be captured before we move to the next step.

If there is no objection, the proposal is adopted, and we move to the next agenda item.

Check out:After all Agenda items are done and discussed, each person can share a closing reflection on this meeting. No discussion.

### Daily stand up meeting (not mandatory)
When: Every day at 19:00 Barcelona Time (UTC+1)
Where: https://meet.jit.si/daily-giveth
Historical Meetings: Video on YouTube
Description: Optional daily standup meeting lead by Vojtech. Every participant in turn answers 3 simple questions:

1. What have they been working on since last time they attended the meeting.
2. What are they going to work on in the next day(s).
3. What is blocking their progress.
The answers to these questions should not take longer than 3 minutes per person. If you can not attend the meeting, you are invited to share your answers to the #giveth_daily Slack channel.
