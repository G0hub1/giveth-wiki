# Team Organization

## <a name="teamorga_circles">Governance & Circles</a>
Giveth DAC is organized into four different circles to better manage the requirements of the many different engagements of the Giveth DAC. Each circle is appointed a lead person as final decision-maker.

Those four circles and their leads are:

  - Governance - led by @griffgreen
  - Communication - led by @krrisis
  - Product Development - led by @vojtech
  - Social Coding - led by @yalor
