1. A meeting Facilitator and Secratary are determined before the meeting begins, the facilitator moderates the discussion and the Secratary takes notes.
1. Everyone checks-in by telling what is currently distracting them.
1. A meeting agenda is created. Agenda items are always proposals for new Policies or Roles described by 3 words or less.
1. The meeting facilitator goes in turns over the agenda and for every item:
  - The Proposer describes the tension and in one sentence makes a proposal. The proposal should in general be creation of a circle, role or policy.
  - All the meetings participants are can ask clarifying questions about the tension or proposal.
  - The topic proposer repeats the proposal if there were any questions.
  - All meeting participants in turn express their reactions.
  - After the reaction round, the topic proposer can amend their proposal.
  - Any meeting participant can object to the proposal.
  - The topic proposer can amend their proposal and if there are no more objections the topic passes.
1. The Secratary summarizes the meeting.
1. Everyone in turn checks-out by expressing their opinion on the meeting.
