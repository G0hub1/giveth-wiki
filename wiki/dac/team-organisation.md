# Team Organization

## <a name="teamorga_circles">Governance & Circles</a>
Giveth DAC is organized into four different circles to better manage the requirements of the many different engagements of the Giveth DAC. Each circle is appointed a lead person as final decision-maker.

Those four circles and their leads are:

  - Governance - led by @griffgreen
  - Communication - led by @krrisis
  - Product Development - led by @vojtech
  - Social Coding - led by @yalor

For more details, please see [our governance model](../dac/governance/)

1. **Everyone checks-in** by voicing their intention for the meeting and revealing momentary personal distractions.
1. **A meeting agenda is created.** Agenda items are come from Loomio threads.
1. **The meeting facilitator goes over the agenda and for every item:**
  - The Proposer describes the tension and in one sentence makes a proposal. The proposal should in general be creation of a circle, role or policy.
  - All the meetings participants may ask clarifying questions about the tension or proposal.
  - The topic proposer repeats the proposal if there were any questions.
  - All meeting participants in turn express their reactions.
  - After the reaction round, the topic proposer can amend their proposal.
  - Any meeting participant can object to the proposal.
  - The topic proposer can amend their proposal and if there are no more objections the topic passes.
1. The **Secretary summarizes** the meeting.
1. **Everyone in turn checks-out** by expressing their opinion on the meeting.
