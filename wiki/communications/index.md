<h1>Giveth Communications</h1>

Welcome to the little 'homepage' of the Giveth Communications Circle!


Communication Meetings are held weekly online and can be found scheduled on the [Giveth calendar](../dac/calendar/). The meeting room can be found [here](https://meet.jit.si/giveth-communication) and the corresponding Riot channel is [here](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-communication:matrix.org), feel free to join us!
If you want to get a feel of what we discuss during our weekly meetings, all of them can be found on our [Giveth Transparency YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdqmP4axeI1hNmX20aZsOwg).

Below you can find an overview of the goals we are working towards and if you're interested to check out some of the projects we are currently working on to achieve these, do check the zenhub-styled overview of all the open [comms 'issues' which we track on GitHub](https://github.com/Giveth/Communication#workspaces/communication-5a9af84bda4c4d750d00ff36/boards?repos=123724626). 

If you have any question or are interested to contribute, feel free to reach out to @krrisis in the #communications channel on [Riot](http://giveth.io/join)!
