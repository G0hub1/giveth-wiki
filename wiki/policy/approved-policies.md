# Giveth DAC - jointly approved policies

## <a name="process">Section1: Process</a>
These points should influence creation of a new proposal:

1. Active policies
2. Advice process
3. Is it safe enough to try?

All active policies can be challenged!

The policy forming process at Giveth has been evolved to this flow of actions:

1. Policies must start as formal proposals on [Giveth DAC loomio](https://www.loomio.org/g/RQZt4qJ3/giveth)
2. The proposal shall be advertised by the proposer in relevant chat channels (please see Advice Process)
3. If there is disagreement, the proposal is taken to the Governance Meeting, otherwise it passes automatically.
4. A proposal that has been passed needs its outcome **to be shared by the proposer on loomio**
5. The proposal is recorded on the current page on the Wiki in Section2.

### How the DAC uses the DApp
```"Everybody on the whitelist is allowed to create DACs and campaigns"```
see [Gov Meeting #39](../protocol/gov-meeting-39/) and [loomio](https://www.loomio.org/p/XQBSc0qa/whitelists-and-creating-dac-s-and-campaigns-at-will)

### Finances
```"If the governance campaign runs out of money, Griff is allowed to donate to it"```
see [Gove Meeting #35](../protocol/gov-meeting-35/)

### Governance Process

```"Proposals have to go on loomio first - If no one objects on loomio, the proposal is passed. If somebody objects the proposal is discussed at the next Governance Meeting"```
see [Gov meeting #41](../protocol/gov-meeting-41/) and [loomio](https://www.loomio.org/p/LkOa8KT4/which-proposals-are-proposed-in-governance-meeting)

```"A standardized workflow for policies is in place that new proposals should follow"```
see [Section1: Process](#process) and [loomio](https://www.loomio.org/p/TB0HaIfi/have-a-standard-workflow-to-record-policies)

```"A roles meeting should commence regularly - proposal suggests one per month"```
see [Gov Meeting #37](../protocol/gov-meeting-37/)
