# Giveth Donation Application (Beta)

![Beta in Progress](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*XouMtIGMcBmuX4k6)

## Current status
The Giveth Donation Platform is live in *beta* stage on the Ethereum mainnet, bridged to Rinkeby testnet. [About the Giveth Dapp](https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-the-future-of-giving-d50446b0a0e4)

It's been a quest getting to mainnet efficiency, challenged by scalability issues that were too prohibitive for real use, but we found a smooth solution with a bridge. You can read a more detailed account here: [Tackling Ethereum scalability issues (medium post)](https://medium.com/giveth/tackling-ethereum-scalability-issues-29bd700b5060)
