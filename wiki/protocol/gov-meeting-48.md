### Point1&2
Last week the proposals to add Jeff and Michael to gov campaign reg rewards were passed on one amended condition: that they would put their roles in the roles sheet *before* we officially bring them in, and they entered all their roles with supervision from Loie and Griff so this week there was no objections and they were officially welcomed in.
