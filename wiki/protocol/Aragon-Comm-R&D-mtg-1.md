## Action Items so far:
Chat bridge - kay is working on it, tatu says it's working today! they have been working on it together
Recruiting effort - have worked w/ lorelei on finding some candidates, haven't reached out yet except for daniel constantine who Quazia is already in comm with. Brett said there's a candidate who is a pass for AragonOne but may be a good idea for giveth. Would like to hear ppl's opinions on protocol with this... Maria says no opinion really, the way the two teams operate are different so this is ok. Monica manages hiring at Aragon. Tatu says we updated Aragon wiki so that jobs listings reflect multiple teams - **Griff will make sure monica sends all non-hardline rejects to us!**  <br>
Create the DAC - what is known as Labs will be renamed  <br>
Getting donation - **we will create an account for Maria to send funds to. 2 step process.** Vojtech says its only eth, doesn't support other tokens yet. Maria says first payout will be in eth <br>
Quazia - we need to have the logo on the medium article when we announce <br>
Biweekly community calls - Labs: Friday for now, hoping to change the day once we get a few more ppl on. All devs call on Mondays 6pm CEST, only relevant team members until we get kinks worked out. We can open it up later. No livestream yet.  <br>
Publicity - Aragon DAC or Aragon.DAC like Aragon.One - this is only for the domain. Quazia suggested Ara DAC. When we announce, Aragon will put DAC as an extra team on their website. Announcement could be a joint post on both medium accounts, twitter sharing and subreddit. Maria will probably take over responsibility of the announcement while tatu is on vacay. How do we kick off writing of this? Aragon's writers orrr..? Maria will move to have payout as soon as possible, so we shouldn't wait on that to start working. We can start with a draft while tatu is on holiday, makes sense to come from giveth writers. **Kris and griff start working on a draft together in person on Monday,** we will share it with Aragon thru Maria for review/collab.  <br>
Logo - waiting for proposals, quazia checked in with him today, we should have **proposals within the next day or two, a couple days after that to get supplemental brand identity, we should see something in the group chat by monday** <br>
Lawyers - there will be an agreement similar to the nest agreement, very simple, we'll share it with you as soon as the lawyers have it ready. Somebody at giveth has to sign it? We can work around that.  <br>
ReNaming Labs - participate in the straw poll! We'll see if theres consensus, not too urgent, we def have over the weekend. straw poll boosted in chat and voila: Name chosen! "Community R&D"
Creating job listings so we can add them to the wiki  <br>
Drafting copy(description) for the development campaign <br>
Lindsay and Lorelei can help with sourcing candidates, and work with Quazia on job listings.
**Griff and Quazia go over roles we want filled before posting the job listings.** Quazia bug griff!! 
Using github with zenhub integration - should we start this with recruitment, logo, and starting text
Do we do this under giveth or aragon github? or creat separate repository? 
Let's utilize google docs, we can link them in zenhub/github
Maria says it makes total sense to do it on Aragon repository! Since it will be owned by aragon in the future. 
**Tatu team up with Kris on getting team on zenhub.** Kris will be the welcome party to zenhub for those who aren't comfortable with it yet.
