<h1>Goals of the Social Coding Circle</h1>

To get a good idea of what the circle is about please check out the article ["What is Social Coding?"](https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-social-coding-fa81feacfa32) by Quazia. 



<h2> Primary Goal </h2>

* Provide resources, education and support for developers, focusing on blockchain4good & boosting the Ethereum/blockchain ecosystem

* Create a safe space for developers to communicate their passion projects, then recruit help or guidance from peers.

<h2> Secondary Goal </h2>

* Making sure that the smart contracts we create are well documented, and any project that wants to build out using any of our tech has the guidance that they need.

* Oversee anything beyond basic DApp development in the Giveth Galaxy

Meetings are held online bi-weekly and are scheduled on the [Giveth calendar](../dac/calendar/). There you will also find the meeting [link](https://meet.jit.si/StrangeSheepSearchSadly).
