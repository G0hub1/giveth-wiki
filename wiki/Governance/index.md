<h1> Governance Circle Goals </h1>

<h2> Primary Goals</h2> 

* <b>Internal Governance Exploration:</b> Experiment with Ã nd document decentralized governance structures within the Giveth DAC (e.g. Holacracy, RewardDAO, Liquid Pledging, etc) that could be useful for future Decentralized Altruistic Organizations to learn from and implement (Modeling DACs).

* <b> Improving the Ethereum Commons: </b> Get the Blockchain (in Blockchain4Good) going. When Giveth runs into a problem, like scaling, help solve that problem for everyone not just ourselves. This expresses itself by collaborating in various working groups such as: Governance, Signaling, Block Explorers, Scaling, etc. 

* <b> Giveth Bureaucracy:</b> Cover basic needs of the Giveth DAC to function, such as creating & maintaining basic team structure, conflict resolution, administration, financial transparency, organization of team gatherings and quality assurance / quality control.

* <b> Giveth Donations: </b> Oversee donation raising for the Giveth DAC through grants and reaching out to the community.

<h2> Secondary Goals </h2>

* <b> External Collaboration: </b> Instigate and foster collaborations between other decentralized projects for the Giveth platform and aid in onboarding projects to the DApp (especially around advising the implementation of their own unique governance).

* <b>Strategy and Scope:</b> Lead the conversation in overall strategy especially in narrowing scope and selecting the audience to focus on.

Community Meetings are held weekly online and can be found scheduled on the [Giveth calendar](../dac/calendar/). The meeting room can be found [here](https://meet.jit.si/giveth-gov) and the corresponding Riot channel [here](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-governance:matrix.org).
